# Creating a Personal Voice Assistant
A personal voice assistant is the software that can perform tasks and provide different services to the individual as per the individualâ€™s dictated commands. This is done through a synchronous process involving recognition of speech patterns and then, responding via synthetic speech. Through these assistants a user can automate tasks ranging from typing but not limited to mailing, tasks management, and media playback. As technology is developing day by day people are becoming more dependent on it, one of the most used platforms is computers. We all want to make the use of these computers more comfortable. The traditional way to give a command to the computer is through keyboard but a more convenient way is to input the command through voice. Giving input through voice is not only beneficial for the normal people but also for those who are visually impaired who are not able to give the input by using a keyboard. For this purpose, there is a need for a voice assistant which can not only take command through voice but also execute the desired instructions and give output either in the form of voice or any other means.
